# AI-Powered Smart Cataloging

## Pain Point
Manual catalog creation is slow and error-prone. Sellers spend significant time manually entering product details, leading to inconsistent data quality and reduced productivity.

## Proposed Solution
An AI-powered system that automatically generates product details from image uploads. The system uses computer vision and NLP to extract category, title, and description information, which sellers can then review and edit before publishing.

## Architecture
- **Computer Vision**: Analyzes product images to identify visual features and objects
- **NLP Generation**: Creates compelling product titles and descriptions
- **Review Interface**: Allows sellers to edit AI-generated content before publishing
- **Learning System**: Improves over time based on seller feedback and corrections

## Files
- `backend/api.py`: FastAPI backend for AI detail generation
- `frontend/src/CatalogForm.jsx`: React component for catalog creation interface
- `package.json`: Frontend dependencies
- `requirements.txt`: Backend dependencies

## Usage
Sellers upload product images, and the AI system automatically generates suggested titles, descriptions, and categories. Sellers can review, edit, and approve the generated content before publishing their listings.
