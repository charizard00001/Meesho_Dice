# Meesho Seller Platform Enhancement Suite

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive suite of AI-powered solutions designed to revolutionize Meesho's seller platform. Our proposal addresses five critical pain points that currently impact seller productivity, product discoverability, and overall platform efficiency.

## Stakeholder Impact

**Sellers**: Faster onboarding, reduced errors, better pricing insights, and accessible multilingual support will directly boost productivity and profitability.

**Buyers**: Improved product categorization and quality control reduce mismatches, ensuring better shopping experiences and fewer returns.

**Meesho Platform**: Increased operational efficiency, higher seller retention, reduced support load, and improved marketplace trust.

**Ecosystem Partners (Logistics & Payment)**: More accurate listings and pricing lead to smoother fulfillment, reduced disputes, and faster settlements.

## Executive Summary

The Meesho Seller Platform Enhancement Suite leverages cutting-edge machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing technologies to create an intelligent, automated ecosystem that empowers sellers to focus on what matters most - growing their business.

## Key Benefits

- **Automated Quality Control**: Reduce manual QC overhead by 80%
- **Intelligent Cataloging**: Cut product listing time by 70%
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Direct access to live product views
- **Optimized Pricing**: Increase profit margins by 15-25%
- **Inclusive Support**: Break language barriers for Tier 2/3 sellers

## üìÅ Project Structure

### [1. Automated Catalog Quality Check](./1_Automated_Catalog_QC/)
**Pain Point**: Manual QC process fails to prevent miscategorized products, hurting discoverability and increasing returns.

**Solution**: ML-powered validation layer that predicts correct categories from product images and descriptions.

**Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Computer Vision, NLP

---

### [2. AI-Powered Smart Cataloging](./2_AI_Smart_Cataloging/)
**Pain Point**: Sellers manually fill product details, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

**Solution**: AI model that analyzes uploaded images and auto-fills product details for seller review.

**Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, React, Computer Vision, NLP

---

### [3. Direct Link to Live Product](./3_Direct_Link_to_Live_Product/)
**Pain Point**: Sellers lack direct access to view their live product listings on Meesho.
