# AI-Powered Smart Pricing

## Pain Point
Suboptimal pricing leads to lost sales and profit. Sellers struggle to set competitive prices that maximize both sales volume and profit margins, often resulting in either overpricing (reducing sales) or underpricing (reducing profits).

## Proposed Solution
An ML model that recommends profit-maximizing prices by analyzing multiple data sources including sales history, competitor pricing, market trends, and return rates. The system provides intelligent pricing suggestions that balance competitiveness with profitability.

## Architecture
- **Data Integration**: Aggregates sales data, competitor data, and return data
- **ML Pricing Model**: Uses regression and optimization algorithms for price prediction
- **Return Rate Analysis**: Incorporates return penalties into pricing calculations
- **Market Intelligence**: Monitors competitor pricing and market trends
- **Profit Optimization**: Balances sales volume with profit margins

## Files
- `src/pricing_model.py`: Core ML model for price optimization
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Usage
The system analyzes product performance data and market conditions to recommend optimal pricing strategies. Sellers receive actionable pricing suggestions with confidence scores and expected impact on sales and profits.
