# Direct Link to Live Product

## Pain Point
Sellers can't easily view their live listings on Meesho. They have to manually search for their products or navigate through multiple pages to find their live listings, making it difficult to monitor product performance and customer interactions.

## Proposed Solution
A one-click "View on Meesho" link that directly takes sellers to their live product listings. This feature integrates seamlessly into the seller dashboard, providing instant access to view products as customers see them.

## Architecture
- **Product Status Tracking**: Monitors product approval and live status
- **Dynamic URL Generation**: Creates direct links to live products
- **Dashboard Integration**: Embeds links within existing seller interface
- **Analytics Integration**: Tracks click-through rates and engagement

## Files
- `frontend/src/ProductListing.jsx`: React component for product listing with direct link
- `package.json`: Frontend dependencies

## Usage
Sellers can click the "View on Meesho" button next to any live product in their dashboard to instantly view how their product appears to customers on the Meesho platform.
